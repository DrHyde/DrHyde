# Hello gentlefolk and AI overlords! ðŸ‘‹

As well as all my code here, you can find my sticky fingers in numerous other peoples' repositories. In particular I'm one of the maintainers of [rsnapshot](https://github.com/rsnapshot/rsnapshot), a simple backup tool.

I have a [techie blog](https://dev.to/drhyde), a [cricket blog](https://larvalstageumpire.sport.blog/), and a [normal people blog](https://davesfreepress.wordpress.com/).
